## 🤔 Who we are
We are a bunch of university students that wanted that our university had more projects related to cybersecurity,
we got tired of waiting this to happen and decided to create one ourselves!

## ℹ️ What do we aim to achieve
Through this project we hope to build a big collaborative community revolve around the subject of cybersecurity
where people can acquire and share knowledge, thereafter improving the overall academic experience on our university.
